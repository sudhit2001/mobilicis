# Full Stack Project.

In this project we created Node.js Application using Express Framework and MongoDB Database. In the end we got an API endpoint. We interacted with that API through ReactJS and solved the given 5 queries.

## Backend:-

* To create a REST API with Node.js and MongoDB we installed the express, body parser and mongoose. 
* Next we setup the server on the port 3000 
* Next we created a separate file for your API routes and define the endpoints that your API will provide. 
* Next we configured the mongoDB Database and connected that to our nodeJS application. 
* I then added all the sample data to our database. 
* I now have all the REST endpoints such as POST, GET, DELETE ready with us.

## Frontend:- 

* I downloaded the react modules and libraries to interact with the API and display the result of all queries on a webpage. 
* I did a setup and applied basic css. 
* Used axios library in React to get all data from the API. 
* Used .filter() function to manipulate the data according to our queries and store our output in a variable. 
* Next we used the map function to traverse through all the values of the variable and displayed them in the table() tag using JSX. 
* I rendered the app.js to the browser with the output.

## Queries:- 

* I used basic programming logic to filter data. 
* I had used regular expressions too. 
* For the last query, I used map to calculate the count and income of each city and individual respectively. I stored them in a variable and calcuated the count and average income.
